# Google-Book-Search (MERN STACK)
This application uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to obtain information from the user and Google Books API. The user may search for books via title and/or author. Books will populate on the UI and the user can choose to visit Google Books (where they can purchase the book) or, they may save the book in their personal library. An API call is used to obtain the response to the user search. MongoDB is used for saving the books. Two servers concurrently run, one for react, and one for node. Routing is handled by express for the Node server, and the react router is used to handle front end routing.
